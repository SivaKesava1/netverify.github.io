With the increasing scale of communication networks, 
failures (e.g. link failures) are becoming the norm rather than the
exception. Given the critical role such networks play for our
digital society, it is important to ensure a reliable and
efficient operation of such networks, even in the presence
of one or multiple failures. 
While several interesting automated approaches to 
verify and operate networks are emerging, offering an attractive
alternative to today’s pragmatic and manual “fix it when it breaks” approach, existing solutions often only provide a limited and inefficient 
support for reasoning about failure
scenarios. In particular, verifying networks is a complex task, even for computers. For example, many existing automated 
solutions require to test each possible failure scenario  (respectively, each possible dataplane) individually, resulting in a runtime which can be exponential in the number of failures; which makes this approach impractical for large-scale communication networks. In fact, certain communication networks, such as networks based on MultiPath Label Switching (MPLS) or Segment Routing (SR), may even have a theoretically infinite configuration space: in MPLS and SR networks, default routes as well as failover routes depend on the label stack in the packet header, which may grow and shrink arbitrarily along the route. 
           
In this article, we argue that automata-theoretic approaches can offer an interesting solution to these problems, allowing to perform fast verification, accounting even for failure scenarios and dealing with potentially infinite state spaces.

## A case for verifying network configurations

Before delving into the details, we first argue that it is often attractive to verify the
network configuration directly: compared to verifying
control plane protocols, analyzing the dataplane
configuration (e.g., forwarding and conditional
failover tables) has the advantage that it
also accounts for possible external changes,
e.g., manual changes through the CLI, bugs, or 
changes made by
additional protocols. Moreover, dataplane-based approaches can also reveal 
problems in the network operation introduced by the algorithms
that generate the routing tables from the control plane specifications.

Let us consider the verification of forwarding rules in MPLS routing tables as an example.
In a nutshell, in MPLS, packet labels can be nested 
in order to provide tunneling through the network or to handle link
failures by fast-reroute mechanism. This mechanism relies on pushing a new MPLS
label on top of the label stack, to redirect the flow 
to go around the failed link. This mechanism can be applied several times
in case of multiple link failures, creating larger and larger (in theory: unbounded)
numbers of MPLS labels on the label-stack.

A fairly general query language which supports to reason about network behavior under failures could be based on regular expressions:

$ < a > b < c > k $ 

Here $a$ and $c$ are regular expressions over MPLS labels that describe the 
set of allowed initial resp. final headers of packets in the
trace, $b$ is a regular expression over the links in the network, defining the set
of allowed routing traces through the network, and $k$ is a number
specifying the maximum number of failed links to be accounted for. 


By using regular expressions, we can test properties such as waypoint enforcement (e.g., is the
traffic always forwarded through an intrusion detection system)
or avoidance of certain routers in selected countries. 

## How does polynomial-time what-if analysis work?

In order to evaluate such queries and conduct what-if analysis quickly, we make the case for a model-checking algorithm 
which is based on automata theory. Our approach is motivated by a natural (but not well-known) connection to the theory 
of pushdown automata and prefix rewriting systems.
In a nutshell, given the network configuration, the routing tables,
as well as the query, a pushdown automaton (PDA) can be constructed.
On this PDA, we can then perform a standard reachability analysis. In more details,
the regular expressions for the initial header and the final
header of the query can each be converted to first a
Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) and then to a Pushdown
Automaton (PDA). The path query is converted to an NFA, which can then be used to restrict (by synchronous product)
the behaviour of the PDA constructed based on the network model.
The three PDAs can be combined into a single PDA that we can give
to the backend engine that checks the emptiness of the PDA language. 
In case the language is nonempty, we can return a witness trace
to demonstrate the reason why the query is satisfied. All these operations can be performed in polynomial time, 
leveraging a classic result by J. Büchi.

## The AalWiNes Tool and Example

As a case study and to explore the feasibility of such an automata-theoretic approach, 
we developed a framework, the AalWiNes suite, which allows to load an arbitrary network topology 
(e.g., from the topology zoo dataset) as well as a set of router configurations (e.g., from Juniper routers). 
The configurations are then put into a standardized, intermediate format which is vendor independent. 
The user can then define a query as described above, which leads the tool to prompt with a result 
(e.g. a trace). AalWiNes is a joint work at Aalborg University and the University of Vienna.

For MPLS specifically, we have devloped the AalWiNes tool suite, implemented in C++, and improving upon an earlier
prototype implementation in Python [[1]](#references).
The tool allows to verify a wide range of important network properties in polynomial time, 
parameterized by the $k$. 

Here is a quick intro to AalWines, using an interative 
web-browser integration of our tool available at [demo.aalwines.cs.aau.dk](https://demo.aalwines.cs.aau.dk/):

AalWiNes also allows to account for more complex traffic engineering aspects, such as load-balancing, 
by supporting nondeterminism, as well as more complex multi-operation chains.
The tool includes several optimizations to further improve the performance, such as “top of stack reduction”,
which safely calculates which labels can be at the top of stack in a given state of the PDA: the top of stack
reduction technique greatly reduces the amount of transitions in the PDA.

We refer to our [tool website](https://aalwines.cs.aau.dk/) as well as to our 
[project website](https://github.com/DEIS-Tools/AalWiNes).

## Conclusion and future work

We consider providing a low runtime critical for the success of network verification, 
and reasoning about failures seems particularly challenging. 
While not every network may allow for a polynomial-time analysis,
we see much potential in automata-theoretic approaches,
and we hope this article can inspire the community to conduct more research 
in this area.

We understand our approach as a first step and believe that it opens the door to 
verify many other infinite state systems whose configurations 
cannot explicitly be represented anymore.
For example, we have recently extended AalWiNes to support a witness trace generation which 
accounts for additional metrics, and for example selects (among a possibly infinite number of witness traces) 
the ones that minimize the number of hops, latency, or the stack height that corresponds to the number 
of MPLS tunnels. This is
achieved by extending the PDA reachability analysis with multi-dimensional weights. 

Another interesting avenue for future research is
the study of similar approaches for control plane verification
or for supporting capacity planning, also taking into account
resource constraints on failover paths.
