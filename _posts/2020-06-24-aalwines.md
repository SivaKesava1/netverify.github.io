With the increasing scale of communication networks, 
failures (e.g. link failures) are becoming the norm rather than the
exception. Given the critical role such networks play for our
digital society, it is important to ensure a reliable and
efficient operation of such networks, even in the presence
of one or multiple failures. 
While several interesting automated approaches to 
verify and operate networks are emerging, providing an attractive
alternative to today’s pragmatic and manual “fix it when it breaks” approach, existing solutions often only provide a limited and inefficient 
support for reasoning about failure
scenarios. In particular, many of these solutions 
essentially require to test each possible failure scenario
one-by-one. 
The resulting runtime is exponential in the number of failures, $k$,
which makes this approach not very well-suited for testing 
large-scale communication networks.

## A case for verifying network configurations

It is often attractive to verify the
network configuration directly: compared to verifying
control plane protocols, analyzing the dataplane
configuration (e.g., forwarding and conditional
failover tables) has the advantage that it
also accounts for possible external changes,
e.g., manual changes through the CLI, bugs, or 
changes made by
additional prototcols. Moreover, this approach can also reveal 
problems in the network operation introduced by the algorithms
that generate the routing tables from the control plane specifications.
In our work we focus on the verification of forwarding rules
in MPLS routing tables. In MPLS, packet labels can be nested 
in order to provide tunneling through the network or to handle link
failures by fast-reroute mechanism. This mechanism relies on pushing a new MPLS
label on top of the label stack, to redirect the flow 
to go around the failed link. This mechanism can be applied several times
in case of multiple link failures, creating larger and larger (in theory: unbounded)
numbers of MPLS labels on the label-stack.

To this end, we have developed a tool called P-Rex [[1]](#references)
in Python, that has been recently reimplemented in C++ and integrated into
the AalWiNes [project website](https://github.com/DEIS-Tools/AalWiNes-Web) network verification suit developed jointly
by researchers at Aalborg University and the University of Vienna.
Our tool is currently tailored towards MPLS and Segment Routing (SR) networks, exploiting 
that their routing and failover behavior is based on stacks of labels.
The tool allows to verify a
wide range of important network properties in polynomial time,
parameterized by the maximum number of assumed link failures. 
At the core of the tool lies an expressive query language for reachability
analysis, based on regular expressions, both to specify packet headers as well
as constraints on the routes. Specifically, queries are of the form:

$ < a > b < c > k $ 

where $a$ and $c$ are regular expressions over MPLS labels that describe the 
set of allowed initial resp. final headers of packets in the
trace, $b$ is a regular expression over the links in the network, defining the set
of allowed routing traces through the network, and $k$ is a number
specifying the maximum number of failed links to be accounted for. 


By using regular expressions, we can  
test properties such as waypoint enforcement (e.g., is the
traffic always forwarded through an intrusion detection system)
or avoidance of certain routers in selected countries. 
The tool also allows to account for more complex
traffic engineering aspects, such as load-balancing, by supporting
nondeterminism, as well as more complex multi-operation chains.

## How does polynomial-time what-if analysis work?

The model checking algorithm relies on an automata-theoretic approach
and leverages a natural (but not
well-known) connection to the theory of pushdown automata and
prefix rewriting systems.
In a nutshell, given the network configuration, the routing tables,
as well as the query, the tool constructs a pushdown automaton
(PDA). This PDA is then an input for the backend tool (earlier we used Moped,
more recently we have developed our own dedicated verification engine)
that is used for reachability analysis. In more details,
the regular expressions for the initial header and the final
header  of the query are each converted to first a
Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) and then to a Pushdown
Automaton (PDA). The path query is converted to an NFA, which is
used to restrict (by synchronous product)
the behaviour of the PDA constructed based on the network model.
The three PDAs are combined into a single PDA that we give to
to the backend engine that checks the emptiness of the PDA language. 
In case the language is nonempty, the tool returns a witness trace
to demonstrate the reason why the query is satisfied. Otherwise the
answer is that the query is not satisfied.
In the most recent extension, we modify the witness trace generation
so that we can generate (among a possibly infinite number of witness traces)
the ones that minimize certain criteria (e.g. the number of hops, latency,
and the stack height that corresponds to the number of tunnels). This is
achieved by extending the PDA reachability analysis with multi-dimensional weights.
Despite the added complexity, the verification can be still performed in polynomial time.

The tool includes several optimizations to
further improve the performance, such as “top of stack reduction”,
which safely calculates which labels can be at the top of stack in a
given state of the PDA: the top of stack reduction technique greatly
reduces the amount of transitions in the PDA.

## Example

To be more concrete, our tool allows to load an arbitrary network
topology (e.g., from the topology zoo dataset) as well
as a set of router configurations (e.g., from Juniper routers).
The configurations are then put into an standardized, intermediate
format which is vendor independent. The user can then define
a query (see above), which leads the tool to prompt with a result
(e.g. a trace).

[project website](https://github.com/DEIS-Tools/AalWiNes-Web).

## Conclusion and future work

We consider providing a low runtime critical for the success of network 
verification, and reasoning about failures seems particularly challenging.
We hence hope that our approach, which is specific to MPLS and Segment Routing networks, 
will inspire the community to conduct  more research on the feasiblity
of fast and polynomial time what-if analysis algorithms, also for other network types
and control plane protocols.
